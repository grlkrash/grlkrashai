LYRICS:

I don’t take drugs I been off psilocybin 
Wanna give up I don’t know why I’m trying 
Wanna give up I didn’t know why I’m trying 
Way I feel so alone got me crying 

I feel so alone got me crying 
Can’t even lie me and her we was vibing
Last girl left me swear I was trying 
Told her I would change but I swear I was lying 

Everywhere I go I don’t fit in 
Can’t see life no different 
I ain’t tryna go back where I been 
Just me and my demons yeah 

So broken but I still try to win 
Broken but I still try to win 

Me against me I wonder who win?
Back then they all called me weird 
Now I pop out and they all gone stare
(Yeah they all gone stare)

When she with me she feel famous 
And I like the way she shaped yeah 

Pray that she ain’t faking 
I pray that she ain’t faking 
I can’t trust nobody 
And I ain’t got no patience 

Hook/outro

I don’t take drugs I been off psilocybin 
Wanna give up I don’t know why I’m trying 
Wanna give up I didn’t know why I’m trying 
Way I feel so alone got me crying 

I feel so alone got me crying 
Can’t even lie me and her we was vibing
I don’t take drugs I been off psilocybin x2
