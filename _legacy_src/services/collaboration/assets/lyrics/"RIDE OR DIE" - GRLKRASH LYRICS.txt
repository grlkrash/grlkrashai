LYRICS:

I wanna ride with you 
I know I might die with you
She said
I'm not afraid 

Oh no, no, no
I'm not afraid

I like I like I like I like
I like it
Yeah

I like I like I like I like I like it
I'm not afraid

I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
I'm not

I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid

She said that I'm not afraid to die
Looking for paradise 
Stuck and I'm paralyzed
I'm not afraid to die

I know that you down to ride
Can see it in your eyes
Come and look me in my eyes
I'll let you see inside

I let you see me cry
Now you're here for life

(INTERLUDE)

DEEP SCARY VOICE:

DANGER STRIKES THE SOUL OF A KILLER...
