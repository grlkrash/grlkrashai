# MOREToken Security Features

## Overview
The MOREToken contract implements multiple layers of security to protect against common vulnerabilities and ensure safe token distribution. This document outlines the security measures in place.

## Core Security Features

### 1. Access Control
- **Authorized Deployer**: Only a specific wallet (`AUTHORIZED_DEPLOYER`) can initialize the contract and perform critical operations
- **Single Initialization**: Contract can only be initialized once through the `notInitialized` modifier
- **Ownable Pattern**: Inherits OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` for standard ownership controls

### 2. Reentrancy Protection
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Implements OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent reentrant calls
- **Critical Functions Protected**: 
  - `enableCirculation`
  - `distributeVestedTokens`
- **CEI Pattern**: Follows Check-Effects-Interactions pattern in all external calls

### 3. Emergency Controls
- **Pausable Functionality**: Contract can be paused in emergency situations
- **Protected Functions During Pause**:
  - All token transfers
  - Vesting distributions
  - Circulation enabling
- **Emergency Events**: All emergency actions are logged with events
  - `EmergencyPaused`
  - `EmergencyUnpaused`

### 4. Rate Limiting
- **Distribution Interval**: Minimum 1-day interval between vesting distributions
- **Vesting Period**: Hard-coded 6-month vesting period
- **Allocation Caps**: Fixed allocations that cannot be modified after deployment
  - Seed Round: 30%
  - Team: 3%
  - Hiring/Incentives: 5%
  - Circulation: 62%

### 5. Liquidity Pool Protection
- **Contract Validation**: Liquidity pool must be a contract address (code.length > 0)
- **Zero Address Check**: Prevents setting zero address as liquidity pool
- **Single Setup**: Circulation can only be enabled once
- **Locked Circulation**: Circulation supply is locked in contract until liquidity pool is set

### 6. Event Logging
All critical operations emit events for off-chain monitoring:
- `VestingDistribution`: Tracks vesting distributions
- `InitialDistribution`: Records initial token allocations
- `CirculationEnabled`: Logs when circulation begins
- `LiquidityPoolSet`: Records liquidity pool address
- `EmergencyPaused`/`EmergencyUnpaused`: Tracks emergency state changes

### 7. State Management
- **Initialization State**: Tracked through `isInitialized` boolean
- **Vesting State**: Monitored through multiple variables
  - `vestingStart`: Timestamp of vesting beginning
  - `lastDistributionTime`: Timestamp of last distribution
  - `totalVestedAmount`: Total tokens vested so far
- **Circulation State**: Tracked through `isCirculationEnabled` boolean

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Input Validation
- All critical parameters are validated before use
- Custom error messages for better debugging
- Constant values for immutable parameters

### 2. Modular Design
- Clear separation of concerns
- Custom modifiers for repeated checks
- View functions for external state queries

### 3. Gas Optimization
- Efficient state updates
- Minimal storage usage
- Optimized calculations

## Security Recommendations

### For Deployers
1. Verify `AUTHORIZED_DEPLOYER` address before deployment
2. Ensure secure storage of deployer private keys
3. Test emergency pause functionality before mainnet deployment
4. Monitor events for unusual activity

### For Users
1. Verify contract is not paused before interactions
2. Check vesting schedule through view functions
3. Verify token allocations match whitepaper
4. Monitor distribution events
